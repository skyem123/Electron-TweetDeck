TweetDeck on Electron
=====================

## NOW ABANDONED
Yeah I don't have the time to maintain this, and I don't use tweetdeck anymore. The code's still here because I don't like deleting stuff, but please ignore this. 

Very short story for this one, I opened the old and obsolete (but until recently, mostly functional) TweetDeck desktop (basically, it loaded the webpage for TweetDeck in its own window), and discovered that it was kinda broken (the icons weren't loading). Knowing that the program I was using was old and not supported anymore, I quickly tweaked [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/atom/electron-quick-start) to load up the TweetDeck webapp into its own window.

It kinda works.

It's sorta buggy, so I'll fix things if and when I find out how to fix them and get the time to.
